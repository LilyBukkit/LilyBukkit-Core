# LilyBukkit

LilyBukkit is an attempt to create a Bukkit-compatible server core for Minecraft version Alpha v1.0.16.05_13 Lilypad from the AlphaVer ARG. This server core is based on [5GameMaker/Rosepad](https://github.com/5GameMaker/Rosepad).

* Current Rosepad version: `7a59e2998816b25d16070b7347972a857dd4c22a`
* Current Bukkit version: `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` aka `beta 1.7.3-R3`

 [//]: # (I'm a madlad by trying to implement 1.7.10 onto a1.0.16, but that's still very interesting)

*More info on the ARG can be found [here](https://alphaver.fandom.com/wiki).*
